Tetris

Clone

Yatc is an attempt at a tetris code written in JAVA. It uses JAVA's built-in high-score system, which creates a file called "scores.dat" in the current working directory. The controls are:

`LEFT-RIGHT`: Move tetramino left/right

`DOWN` Slams tetramino

`Z-X` Rotates tetramino

There isn't a score system implemented, just the number of cleared lines, which is what gets recorded as a high-score. The game also speeds up as you clear lines, to increase difficulty.
